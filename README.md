# pro-purge
Adds purge commands to Cura post-processing options

# Installation
Copy ProPurge.py into your Ultimaker Cura installation in the /plugins/PostProcessingPlugin/scripts folder

# Use
* Load an object to slice in Cura
* Click on Extensions > Post Processing > Modify Gcode
* Click "Add a script"
* Click Pro Purge v.(1.03)
* Set options for your purge line

# Tips
* If you already have a purge line built into your printer configuration START GCODE, you should remove it.
* If you use Blob Purge, you probably don't need a very long purge line.
* Don't start your purge line close to your blob purge
